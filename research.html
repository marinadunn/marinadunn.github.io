							<i style="font-size:15px;">Advisor: <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~mobasher/">Bahram Mobasher</a>; Research Mentors: <a href="https://aleksandraciprijanovic.wordpress.com">Aleksandra Ćiprijanović</a>, <a href="http://briandnord.com/bio">Dr. Brian Nord</a></i></p>
							<p style="font-size:14px;"> My graduate research has focused on harnessing the power
								of deep neural networks to tackle the substantial challenges
								posed by the massive data volumes anticipated from upcoming
								surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
								<a href='https://www.lsst.org'>Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</a>.

								I have been investigating the use of Convolutional Neural Networks
								(as well as Bayesian Neural Networks) and transfer learning techniques
								to classify the morphologies of galaxies in simulated LSST image data
								releases. By mimicking realistic observational conditions, including
								varying levels of observational noise, this project aims to enhance
								our understanding of the impact of noise on classification accuracy.

								Initial findings reveal that the performance of standard networks
								trained on high-noise early data releases can substantially degrade
								when tested on subsequent lower-noise data releases. However, we have
								found that transfer learning techniques can significantly improve model
								performance when evaluating data with different noise levels. This
								research underscores the critical importance of realism in simulating
								astronomical imaging data for machine learning model development. It
								also seeks to establish a foundation for the seamless transition between
								simulated and real observational data, which is essential for the next
								generation of large-scale surveys like LSST.

							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of NASA’s Information, Data, & Analytics Services (IDAS) team,
								I developed a project to support the ongoing agency-wide digital transformation
								effort and the increased demand for data science services. I created multiple
								components to empower NASA teams to learn about ML, experiment with it, and
								evaluate its use for their research. Components included a collection of
								interactive, cloud-based coding notebooks featuring simplified ML models
								(built with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.) and an internal Microsoft SharePoint
								site. By offering a centralized, pre-configured, pre-authenticated space for NASA
								users, we reduced complexity and reluctance to using ML, and enabled quicker, broader
								 adoption throughout the agency.

							<br>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of NASA's Earth Information Systems (EIS) team, I researched optimal
								strategies for migrating and storing NASA Earth Science data and models to the commercial cloud in order to
								allow for faster, more efficient scientific analysis. This included exploring strategies for a variety of
								wildfire-related datasets to integrate into the <a href='https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html'>EIS Fire Portal</a>,
								which is designed to support the scientific understanding and analysis of current and projected fire activity, and
								support organizations focused on fire and air quality forecasting. Our intern team was able to demonstrate the benefits
								of the powerful, cloud-optimized Zarr file format, and the direct effects of certain chunking strategies on processing
								speed and memory usage when performing common data access and analysis operations with large multi-dimensional datasets.
								<br>
								In addition, for the NASA Surface Biology and Geology High-Frequency Time Series (SHIFT) campaign, which involves
								collecting hyperspectral imaging data of vegetation, I designed a data pipeline that transforms raw spectral data
								into the cloud-optimized, analysis-ready Zarr format. This pipeline provides an organized and simplified approach
								to extracting, transforming, visualizing and analyzing data through a Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE).
								I stored this data in a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification-compliant format, which will allow for
								easier future indexing, discovery, and analysis. In addition, I created interactive notebooks demonstrating accessing
								this data from an AWS S3 bucket, and performing common data operations with visualizations. This code is documented on my Github.

							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of the <a href='https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi/class/2022'>LLNL DSSI Class of 2022</a>, I researched
								and developed a visualization tool for better model optimization, specifically for an orbital debris project that uses
								the scaleable Gaussian Process hyper-parameter estimation method 'MuyGPs' for predictive modeling. The goal of this project
								is to accurately fill in gaps of missing observations of orbital debris to complete catalogs of known satellites. This tool
								helps researchers better see the structure of models and which parameters have the most influence on performance. This tool
								will hopefully be expanded to include applications for future astronomical surveys such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
								of Space and Time (LSST), including for research involving galaxy blend classification and weak lensing shear.

								In addition, as part of the DSSI Challenge Problem, I researched various Machine Learning binary classification approaches using

								proteins and ligands will bind. This project contributes to the ongoing global effort to rapidly screen drug-like compounds and
								identify those that may best treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2.

							<br>
							<i style="font: size 15px;">Advisor: <a href='http://eldora.as.arizona.edu/~yshirley/'>Dr. Yancy Shirley</a></i></p>
							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of a research project offered through our undergraduate Astronomy Club, our group observed
								with the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak for several semesters, searching for dense,
								dark clouds that would be good candidates for future star formation. Some of the biggest questions regarding star formation
								include how frequently and rapidly stars are being created in specific environments. In order to better understand these questions,
								we observed 101 starless clumps identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey with specific molecular transitions that may indicate
								that the mass is increasing. We determined 6 that were actively collecting enough material to produce stars. Using a radiative transfer
								model, we found the rate at which these clumps were collecting material ranged approximately 500 - 2000 M⊙/Myr, meaning the cores’
								masses will likely double in a free-fall time. This means they are increasing significantly and may begin producing stars in the near
								future. I co-authored this work, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2018. It is available
								<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00036'>here.</a>

							<br>
							<p style="font-size:15px;">Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL)</p>
							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of my undergraduate research, I collaborated
								on a large team of scientists and engineers from
								various institutions on a weekly basis, wrote
								significant proposal components, procured instrument estimates,
								and managed large budgets for the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/event/gusto/">NASA GUSTO mission</a>
								and the <a href="https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/SIIOS/#:~:text=What%20is%20The%20SIIOS%20Project,of%20different%20planets%20and%20moons">Seismometer to Investigate Ice and Ocean Structure (SIIOS)</a>,
								and successfully organized the NASA GUSTO site visit in January 2017,
								marking its transition into the next phase of the mission and $40
								million in funding. In addition, I wrote proposals, and built and
								tested antenna prototypes in a welding shop for the high resolution,
								inflatable Terahertz Space Telescope. I presented preliminary results
								to the Office of Naval Research (ONR), resulting in full project funding.

								In 2017, I began focusing on the lifecycle of the interstellar medium,
								specifically studying the impact of turbulence from nearby star formation
								on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Using data from the
								SuperCam instrument installed on the Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham,
								I looked at a GMC known as R Coronae Australis (R CrA). This observation
								was part of a larger 500-degree survey of the Milky Way plane with the
								highest spatial resolution yet achieved in this wavelength range. These
								observations focused on a specific molecular transition of carbon monoxide,
								and by calculating the gas temperature and column density (mass thickness)
								of the cloud, I was able to create integrated intensity maps using Python
								and determine the energy balance within the cloud. By doing this, I confirmed
								previous hypotheses that within R CrA, there is a young star generating outflows
								on both sides of the cloud, thereby driving star formation.

							<p style="font-size:14px;"> As part of my first undergraduate research project, I regularly
								observed the transiting exoplanet XO-2b with the 61” Kuiper telescope
								on Mt. Bigelow, and looked at the corresponding light curves of the host star’s light dimming as planet passed in front. I studied the change
								in effective radius of the planet in the various wavelenths to determine
								the composition of the atmosphere. We found that certain data reduction techniques work better than others to help reveal the atmospheric characteristics, such as using brighter nearby reference stars. We
								presented this work at the 2016 American Astronomical Society Meeting.
