							<p> As a Freshman undergraduate, I sought out a research project working with Dr. Rob Zellem and Dr. Caitlin Griffith to characterize the 
                atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. I regularly observed exoplanets like XO-2b, a hot Jupiter-like planet, with the 61” Kuiper telescope 
                on Mt. Bigelow, and looked at the corresponding light curves of the host star’s light dimming as planets passed in front. I studied the change 
                in effective radius of the planet in the U and B bands to determine the composition of the planet atmospheres. We found that certain data 
                reduction techniques work better than others to help reveal the atmospheric characteristics, such as using brighter nearby reference stars. 
                I presented this work at the 2016 American Astronomical Society conference with my peers. As this was my first experience with data analysis, 
                I enjoyed working with my team on ways to reduce error when observing.

							<p> As part of a research project offered through our undergraduate Astronomy Club with Dr. Yancy Shirley, my group 
							observed with the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak for several semesters, searching for dense, 
							dark clouds that would be good candidates for future star formation. Some of the biggest questions regarding star formation 
							include how frequently and rapidly stars are being created in specific environments. In order to better understand these questions, 
							we observed 101 starless clumps identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey with specific molecular transitions that may indicate
							that the mass is increasing. We determined 6 that were actively collecting enough material to produce stars. Using a radiative transfer 
							model, we found the rate at which these clumps were collecting material ranged approximately 500 - 2000 M⊙/Myr, meaning the cores’ 
							masses will likely double in a free-fall time. This means they are increasing significantly and may begin producing stars in the near 
							future. I learned a great deal about the publication process when I co-authored a paper on this work, which was published in the 
							Astrophysical Journal in 2018.

							<a href='http://soral.as.arizona.edu/Welcome.html'><h2>GUSTO/Balloon Telescopes/SuperCam</h2> </a> 
							<p> In 2016, I began working in the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL) with Dr. Chris Walker. My first several months consisted of 
                writing significant proposal components, procuring instrument estimates, and managing large budgets for two NASA missions: the balloon-borne 
                observatory, GUSTO, and the Europa Ice and Ocean Structure Seismometer (SIIOS). I collaborated on a large team of scientists and engineers from 
                various institutions on a weekly basis. In addition, I also successfully organized preparations for the NASA site visit for GUSTO in January of 
                017, marking its transition into the next phase of the mission and $40 million in funding. The following year, I assisted in writing proposals 
                for a high resolution, spherical, space-based, inflatable observatory called the Terahertz Space Telescope, which could be used for observations 
                such as probing protoplanetary disks or observing outgassing on bodies like Europa. For this project, I built antenna prototypes in a welding shop,
                tested them, and presented preliminary results for the Office of Naval Research (ONR), resulting in full project funding. Based on these 
                experiences, I knew I wanted to pursue working on upcoming large-scale space missions. 
                
	              In 2017, I continued working with SORAL, focusing on the lifecycle of the interstellar medium. In particular, I studied the impact of turbulence 
                from nearby star formation on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Using data from the instrument SuperCam installed on the 
                Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham, I looked at a GMC known as R Coronae Australis (R CrA). This observation was part of a larger 500-degree 
                survey of the Milky Way plane with the highest spatial resolution yet achieved in this wavelength range. This observation focused on a specific 
                molecular transition of carbon monoxide, and by using the velocity of the molecule and width of the spectral line, I calculated gas temperature 
                and column density (mass thickness). These measurements allowed me to use Python to create integrated intensity maps and determine the energy 
                balance within the cloud. By doing this, I confirmed previous hypotheses that within R CrA, there is a 
                young star generating outflows on both sides of the cloud, thus driving star formation.
