							<a href='https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssiLLNL'><h2>Data Science Summer Institute Internship(2022-Present)</h2> </a>
							<p> I am currently researching and developing a visualization application 
								for the scaleable Gaussian Process hyper-parameter estimation method MuyGPs, 
								and exploring Gaussian Process applications for future astronomical surveys such as 
								LSST, including research involving galaxy blend classification and weak lensing shear.

							<h2>Classifying Galaxy Morphologies Using Bayesian Neural Networks to Support Future Astronomical Surveys (2021-Present)</h2>
							<p> I currently work on an interdisciplinary research project with Astronomy Professor Dr. Bahram Mobasher (UCR) and Dr. Aleksandra Ciprijanovic (Fermilab) 
								as part of the M.S. Engineering: Data Science Program at UC Riverside. I am currently exploring using Bayesian Nutilizing Bayesian Neural Networks to 
								classify morphologies of early galaxies. I am researching this for both simulated noisy and pristine image data for the upcoming LSST project, as well as
								simulated and real data from the Hubble Space Telescope, in order to compare how the models performs when switching between simulated and real astronomical data, 
								and on additional observational data releases. This will help demonstrate the effects of observational realism on model performance as it shifts between different 
								data sources and newer data releases. The use of Bayesian Neural Networks will allow for obtaining quantified uncertainties in model predictions. I meet with the 
								Deepskies Lab research group weekly to discuss and receive feedback on the project.

							<a href='https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html'><h2>NASA Earth Information Systems Internship (2021-2022)</h2> </a>
							<p> As part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Earth Information Systems (EIS) team, I researched optimal strategies for migrating and storing
								NASA Earth Science data and models to the commercial cloud in order to allow for faster, more efficient analysis for scientific exploration. 
								This included exploring strategies for a variety of wildfire-related datasets to integrate into the cloud-based EIS Fire Portal, which is designed 
								to support the scientific understanding and analysis of current and projected fire activity, and support organizations focused on fire and air quality forecasting.
								Our intern team was able to demostrate the benefits of the powerful, cloud-optimized Zarr file format, and the direct effects of a given chunking strategy on processing 
								speed and memory usage when performing common data access and analysis operations with large multi-dimensional datasets. This work was submitted for publishing to
								the Journal of Earth and Space Sciences in April 2022, and is available here: <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10511054.1'>here.</a> <br>
								<br>
								In additon, for the NASA Surface Biology and Geology High-Frequency Time Series (SHIFT) campaign, which involved collecting hyperspectral imaging data 
								of vegetation, I designed a data pipeline that transforms raw spectral data into the cloud-optimized, analysis-ready Zarr format. This 
								pipeline provides an organized and simplified approach to extracting, transforming, visualizing and analyzing data through a Science 
								Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE). I stored this data in a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification-compliant format, which will 
								allow for easier future indexing, discovery, and analysis. In addition, I created interactive notebooks demonstrating accessing this data from an AWS S3 bucket, 
								and performing common data operations with visualizations. This code is thoroughly documented code on my Github profile.

							<a href='http://uaastroclub.org/projects/radio-astronomy-project/'><h2>UA Astro Club Radio Astronomy Project (2015-2018)</h2> </a>
							<p> As part of a research project offered through our undergraduate Astronomy Club with Dr. Yancy Shirley, my group 
							observed with the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak for several semesters, searching for dense, 
							dark clouds that would be good candidates for future star formation. Some of the biggest questions regarding star formation 
							include how frequently and rapidly stars are being created in specific environments. In order to better understand these questions, 
							we observed 101 starless clumps identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey with specific molecular transitions that may indicate
							that the mass is increasing. We determined 6 that were actively collecting enough material to produce stars. Using a radiative transfer 
							model, we found the rate at which these clumps were collecting material ranged approximately 500 - 2000 M⊙/Myr, meaning the cores’ 
							masses will likely double in a free-fall time. This means they are increasing significantly and may begin producing stars in the near 
							future. I co-authored this work, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2018. It is available <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00036'>here.</a>

							<a href='http://soral.as.arizona.edu/Welcome.html'><h2>GUSTO/Balloon Telescopes/SuperCam (2016-2017)</h2> </a> 
							<p> In 2016, I began working in the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL) with Dr. Chris Walker. My first several months consisted of 
							writing significant proposal components, procuring instrument estimates, and managing large budgets for two NASA missions: the balloon-borne 
							observatory, GUSTO, and the Europa Ice and Ocean Structure Seismometer (SIIOS). I collaborated on a large team of scientists and engineers from 
							various institutions on a weekly basis. In addition, I also successfully organized preparations for the NASA site visit for GUSTO in January of 
							017, marking its transition into the next phase of the mission and $40 million in funding. The following year, I assisted in writing proposals 
							for a high resolution, spherical, space-based, inflatable observatory called the Terahertz Space Telescope, which could be used for observations 
							such as probing protoplanetary disks or observing outgassing on bodies like Europa. For this project, I built antenna prototypes in a welding shop,
							tested them, and presented preliminary results for the Office of Naval Research (ONR), resulting in full project funding. Based on these 
							experiences, I knew I wanted to pursue working on upcoming large-scale space missions. 

							In 2017, I continued working with SORAL, focusing on the lifecycle of the interstellar medium. In particular, I studied the impact of turbulence 
							from nearby star formation on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Using data from the instrument SuperCam installed on the 
							Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham, I looked at a GMC known as R Coronae Australis (R CrA). This observation was part of a larger 500-degree 
							survey of the Milky Way plane with the highest spatial resolution yet achieved in this wavelength range. This observation focused on a specific 
							molecular transition of carbon monoxide, and by using the velocity of the molecule and width of the spectral line, I calculated gas temperature 
							and column density (mass thickness). These measurements allowed me to use Python to create integrated intensity maps and determine the energy 
							balance within the cloud. By doing this, I confirmed previous hypotheses that within R CrA, there is a 
							young star generating outflows on both sides of the cloud, thus driving star formation.

							<a href='https://sites.google.com/a/email.arizona.edu/ua-extrasolar-planet-project/'><h2>Characterizing Transiting Exoplanet Atmospheres - AZGOE (2014-2016)</h2></a>
							<p> As a Freshman undergraduate, I worked with Dr. Rob Zellem and Dr. Caitlin Griffith to characterize the 
							atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. I regularly observed exoplanets like XO-2b, a hot Jupiter-like planet, with the 61” Kuiper telescope 
							on Mt. Bigelow, and looked at the corresponding light curves of the host star’s light dimming as planets passed in front. I studied the change 
							in effective radius of the planet in the U and B bands to determine the composition of the planet atmospheres. We found that certain data 
							reduction techniques work better than others to help reveal the atmospheric characteristics, such as using brighter nearby reference stars. 
							I presented this work at the 2016 American Astronomical Society conference with my peers. This was my first experience with scientific data analysis, 
							where we focused on ways to reduce error when observing.
