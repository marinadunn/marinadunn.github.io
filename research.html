						address the formidable challenges arising from the massive data
						volumes anticipated from upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin
						Observatory's

						clouds--identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey that may be
						good potential candidates for future star formation, with the goal
						of enhancing our understanding of how frequently and rapidly stars

						prestellar cores actively gathering enough material for stellar
						production. Employing a radiative transfer model, we calculated
						material collection rates ranging from approximately 500 to 2000
