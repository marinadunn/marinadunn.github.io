						volumes anticipated from upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin
						Observatory's
						<a href="https://www.lsst.org">Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</a>. Through the exploration of
						Convolutional Neural Networks and
						Bayesian Neural Networks, alongside transfer learning techniques, I
						have been focused on classifying galaxy morphologies in various
						simulated LSST image data releases. By replicating real-world
						observational conditions, including varying levels of observational
						noise, this project aims to illuminate the impact of noise on
						classification accuracy. This investigation underscores the critical
						importance of observational realism in simulated astronomical

						good potential candidates for future star formation, with the goal
						of enhancing our understanding of how frequently and rapidly stars
