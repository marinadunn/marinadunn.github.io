							<b>Galaxy Morphology Classification Using Bayesian Neural Networks for LSST</b>
							<br>
							<b style="font-size:15px;">University of California, Riverside; Deep Skies Lab</b>
							<br>
							<i style="font-size:15px;">Advisor: Dr. Bahram Mobasher; Research Mentors: Dr. Aleksandra Ćiprijanović, Dr. Brian Nord</i>
							<p> For my interdisciplinary graduate research, I collaborate with the <a href="http://briandnord.com/team">Deep Skies Lab team</a>. My 
								research focuses on using deep neural networks, combined with Bayesian statistics and transfer learning techniques, to classify 
								simulated images of various galaxy morphologies in preparation for LSST. I use simulated mock imaging datasets representing observing 
								with LSST after 1 and 10 years to examine the impact of observation realism on model performance. I presented preliminary results at 
								the 2023 241st American Astronomical Society meeting, and was a 2023 UCR Graduate Division Grad Slam Finalist. The code repository for 
								this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/marinadunn/thesis">my GitHub</a>, and is continously updated.

							<b>Detection and Segmentation of Ice Blocks in Europa's Chaos Terrain (NASA GSFC)</b>
							<br>
							<i style="font-size:15px;">Mentor: Dr. Conor A. Nixon</i>
							<p> As part of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Planetary Systems Laboratory, 
								I am currently working on developing deep learning methods, such as Mask R-CNNs, to detect and segment 
								individual ice blocks in the “chaos terrain” regions of Europa in order to better understand geophysical properties and 
								inform future mission planning. I presented initial results at the 2023 OPAG Meeting, and a paper is currently
								in preparation.

							<b>The Machine Learning Showroom (NASA LaRC)</b>
							<br>
							<i style="font-size:15px;">Mentor: Douglas M. Trent</i>
							<p> As part of NASA’s OCIO Information, Data, & Analytics Services (IDAS) team at NASA Langley Research Center, I developed a project known as 
								“The Machine Learning Showroom” to support the ongoing agency-wide digital transformation effort 
								and the increased demand for data science services. I created multiple components to empower NASA teams to learn 
								about Machine Learning and evaluate its use for their research; these included a collection of interactive, 
								cloud-based coding notebooks featuring simplified Machine Learning models (built with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.) 
								and an internal Microsoft SharePoint site. By offering a centralized, pre-configured, pre-authenticated space for 
								NASA users to learn and experiment, we hoped to reduce complexity and reluctance to using Machine Learning and 
								enable quicker and broader adoption throughout the agency. 
							</p>

							<b>Earth Information Systems (NASA GSFC)</b>
							<br>
							<i style="font-size:15px;">Mentor: Dr. Alexey Shiklomanov</i>
							<p> As part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's Earth Information Systems (EIS) team, I researched optimal 
								strategies for migrating and storing NASA Earth Science data and models to the commercial cloud in order to 
								allow for faster, more efficient scientific analysis. This included exploring strategies for a variety of 
								wildfire-related datasets to integrate into the <a href='https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html'>EIS Fire Portal</a>, 
								which is designed to support the scientific understanding and analysis of current and projected fire activity, and 
								support organizations focused on fire and air quality forecasting. Our intern team was able to demonstrate the benefits 
								of the powerful, cloud-optimized Zarr file format, and the direct effects of certain chunking strategies on processing 
								speed and memory usage when performing common data access and analysis operations with large multi-dimensional datasets.
								<br>
								In addition, for the NASA Surface Biology and Geology High-Frequency Time Series (SHIFT) campaign, which involves 
								collecting hyperspectral imaging data of vegetation, I designed a data pipeline that transforms raw spectral data 
								into the cloud-optimized, analysis-ready Zarr format. This pipeline provides an organized and simplified approach 
								to extracting, transforming, visualizing and analyzing data through a Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE). 
								I stored this data in a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification-compliant format, which will allow for 
								easier future indexing, discovery, and analysis. In addition, I created interactive notebooks demonstrating accessing 
								this data from an AWS S3 bucket, and performing common data operations with visualizations. This code is documented on my Github.

							<br>
							<i style="font: size 15px;">Mentor: Dr. Benjamin Priest</i>
							<p> As part of the <a href='https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi/class/2022'>LLNL DSSI Class of 2022</a>, I researched 
								and developed a visualization tool for better model optimization, specifically for an orbital debris project that uses
								the scaleable Gaussian Process hyper-parameter estimation method 'MuyGPs' for predictive modeling. The goal of this project
								is to accurately fill in gaps of missing observations of orbital debris to complete catalogs of known satellites. This tool
								helps researchers better see the structure of models and which parameters have the most influence on performance. You can view 
								my 3-minute Summer Slam Talk on this project on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru11sTYCk98">YouTube</a>. This tool
								will hopefully be expanded to include applications for future astronomical surveys such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey 
								of Space and Time (LSST), including for research involving galaxy blend classification and weak lensing shear.
								<br>
								In addition, as part of the DSSI Challenge Problem, I researched various Machine Learning binary classification approaches using 
								both molecular descriptors and 3D atomic representations to screen drug compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2, predicting whether or not 
								proteins and ligands will bind. This project contributes to the ongoing global effort to rapidly screen drug-like compounds and 
								identify those that may best treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2. More information on this can be found on 
								<a href="https://github.com/marinadunn/covid19-drug-screening-ML">my GitHub</a>.

							<h2>The University of Arizona Steward Observatory</h2>
							<a href='http://uaastroclub.org/projects/radio-astronomy-project/'><b>Astronomy Club Radio Astronomy Project (2015-2018)</b> </a>
							<br>
							<i style="font: size 15px;">Advisor: Dr. Yancy Shirley</i>
							<p> As part of a research project offered through our undergraduate Astronomy Club, our group observed 
								with the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak for several semesters, searching for dense, 
								dark clouds that would be good candidates for future star formation. Some of the biggest questions regarding star formation 
								include how frequently and rapidly stars are being created in specific environments. In order to better understand these questions, 
								we observed 101 starless clumps identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey with specific molecular transitions that may indicate
								that the mass is increasing. We determined 6 that were actively collecting enough material to produce stars. Using a radiative transfer 
								model, we found the rate at which these clumps were collecting material ranged approximately 500 - 2000 M⊙/Myr, meaning the cores’ 
								masses will likely double in a free-fall time. This means they are increasing significantly and may begin producing stars in the near 
								future. I co-authored this work, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2018. It is available 
								<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00036'>here.</a>

							<b>NASA GUSTO/Terahertz Space Telescope/SuperCam (2016-2017)</b>
							<p> In 2016, I began working in the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL) with Dr. Chris Walker. My first several months consisted of 
								writing significant proposal components, procuring instrument estimates, and managing large budgets for two NASA missions: the balloon-borne 
								observatory, GUSTO, and the Europa Ice and Ocean Structure Seismometer (SIIOS). I collaborated on a large team of scientists and engineers from 
								various institutions on a weekly basis. In addition, I also successfully organized preparations for the NASA site visit for GUSTO in January 2017, 
								marking its transition into the next phase of the mission and $40 million in funding. The following year, I assisted in writing proposals 
								for a high resolution, spherical, space-based, inflatable observatory called the Terahertz Space Telescope, which could be used for observations 
								such as probing protoplanetary disks or observing outgassing on bodies like Europa. For this project, I built antenna prototypes in a welding shop,
								tested them, and presented preliminary results for the Office of Naval Research (ONR), resulting in full project funding. Based on these 
								experiences, I knew I wanted to pursue working on upcoming large-scale space missions. 

								In 2017, I continued working with SORAL, focusing on the lifecycle of the interstellar medium. In particular, I studied the impact of turbulence 
								from nearby star formation on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Using data from the instrument SuperCam installed on the 
								Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham, I looked at a GMC known as R Coronae Australis (R CrA). This observation was part of a larger 500-degree 
								survey of the Milky Way plane with the highest spatial resolution yet achieved in this wavelength range. This observation focused on a specific 
								molecular transition of carbon monoxide, and by using the velocity of the molecule and width of the spectral line, I calculated gas temperature 
								and column density (mass thickness). These measurements allowed me to use Python to create integrated intensity maps and determine the energy 
								balance within the cloud. By doing this, I confirmed previous hypotheses that within R CrA, there is a 
								young star generating outflows on both sides of the cloud, thus driving star formation.

							<a href='https://sites.google.com/a/email.arizona.edu/ua-extrasolar-planet-project/'><b>Characterizing Transiting Exoplanet Atmospheres</b></a>
							<br>
							<i style="font: size 15px;">Mentor: Dr. Robert Zellem, Dr. Caitlin Griffith</i>
							<p> As a Freshman undergraduate, I regularly observed exoplanets like XO-2b, a hot Jupiter-like planet, with the 61” Kuiper telescope 
							on Mt. Bigelow, and looked at the corresponding light curves of the host star’s light dimming as planets passed in front. I studied the change 
							in effective radius of the planet in the U and B bands to determine the composition of the planet atmospheres. We found that certain data 
							reduction techniques work better than others to help reveal the atmospheric characteristics, such as using brighter nearby reference stars. 
							I presented this work at the 2016 American Astronomical Society conference with my peers. This was my first experience with scientific data analysis, 
							where we focused on ways to reduce error when observing.
