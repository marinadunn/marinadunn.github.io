								I am a graduate student studying Data Science at the University of California, Riverside. 
								I currently work remotely in my hometown of Nashville, TN. <br>
								<br>
								Previously, I got my Bachelors of Science in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in 2018. 
								I became interested in space at a very early age, and started working at Vanderbilt Dyer Observatory in Nashville, TN 
								when I was 13. I began operating telescopes and giving nightly tours and astronomy talks throughout high school, and 
								became a telescope operator for Steward Observatory. After a year, I was promoted to Chief Telescope Operator, 
								where I oversaw nightly operations of the 21” and 16” Cassegrain telescopes on campus, managed a team of other student operators,
								and continued giving astronomical talks at public observing nights. <br>
								<br>
								From 2018-2021, I worked at Apple, first doing software and hardware repairs, and eventually worked 
								as part of a specialized corporate program for both the Data Analytics Server Engineering team in 2020, 
								and the Strategic Data Solutions Fraud Engineering team in 2021. <br>
								<br>
								From August 2021 - May 2022, I was a graduate intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where I worked on 
								migrating NASA data and models to the commercial cloud, developing cloud-optimized analysis-ready tools for 
								Earth Science datasets, and created a data pipeline for transforming raw hyperspectral vegetation data into 
								the cloud-optimized Zarr format. <br>
								<br>
								With many new observatories like LSST coming online over the next several decades, my research interests focus on
								how Machine Learning techniques can aid in extraction and analysis tasks for big astronomical data in order to 
								improve knowledge discovery. <br>
								<br>
								I also hope to one day go to space, and am passionate about spaceflight and space exploration. I enjoy kayaking, 
								hiking, cycling, doing art, coding, traveling, and cooking. I also love spending time with my family, friends, partner, and my 3 cats.
