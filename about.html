							<h1>Bio</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot of Marina Dunn" style="width:200px;height:250px;" /></span> I'm a first year graduate student studying data science at the University of California, Riverside. Previously, I got my Bachelors of Science in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in 2018. 
								I first became interested in space at the age of 4, and started working at Vanderbilt Dyer Observatory in my hometown of Nashville, TN when I was 13. I began operating telescopes and giving nightly tours and astronomy talks.
								My extensive operations experience continued to develop throughout high school, and on my first day of college, I was chosen as a student telescope operator for Steward Observatory. After a year, I was promoted to Chief Telescope Operator, 
								where I oversaw nightly operations of the 21” and 16” Cassegrain telescopes on campus, and managed a team of other student operators. In this role, I gained valuable telescope operations experience, and became a more confident public speaker by giving astronomical talks at public observing nights.
								
								I previously worked at Apple in Franklin, TN from 2018-2021 doing software and hardware repairs, as well as working in special corporate programs for both the Data Analytics
								Server Engineering team, and Strategic Data Solutions Fraud Engineering team as a Data Science Engineer.
							
								I now currently work at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, working on on migrating NASA data workflows and data models to the cloud. 
								
								My current research interests include Machine Learning techniques for astronomy. With many new observatories like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and JWST coming online in the next several decades, 
								I hope to learn more about the different statistical analysis approaches for the massive amounts of data these surveys will acquire each night. I also hope to be a candidate
								for the astronaut program someday in the future, and am passionate about the fields of spaceflight and space exploration.
								
								I currently live in my homewtown of Nashville, TN. In my free time (and when the pandemic permits again), I enjoy kayaking, hiking, traveling, and cooking. I also
								love spending time with my family, friends, partner, and my 3 cats.
