								I received my M.S. in Engineering: Data Science in June 2023 from
								The University of California, Riverside, and previously received my Bachelor's in Astronomy from The University of Arizona in May 2018.
								<br>
								<br>
								I have always been interested in space since a very early age, and decided to study Astronomy after
								watching the 1997 movie adaptation of Carl Sagan's <i>Contact</i> when I was 13. After this, I
								began volunteering at Vanderbilt University's Dyer Observatory in 2009 leading student space camps,
								operating telescopes, and giving nightly public tours and talks (and still do on occasion). I attended
								the University of Arizona from 2014-2018, where I was a student Telescope Operator, and eventually Chief
								Telescope Operator, for Steward Observatory. Here, I oversaw nightly operations of on-campus telescopes,
								managed a team of other student operators, and continued to give astronomical talks at public observing nights.

								After graduating in 2018, I had to unexpectedly move back to Nashville and began working at Apple, first doing
								software and hardware repairs as part of the Genius Bar team, and later as part of specialized short-term corporate
								programs for Data Engineering and Data Science Engineering in 2020 and 2021. In Fall 2021, I left Apple to begin my
								M.S. program and intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In Summer 2022, I worked as a Computing Scholar at the 2022 Data Science Institute at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
								developing tools for visualizing machine learning model optimization.
								<br>
								<br>
								In Fall 2022, I interned at NASA Langley Research Center on the OCIO Information, Data, & Analytics Services (IDAS) team, and in January 2023, I returned to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to research deep learning
								algorithms for planetary science applications.

								In my free time, I enjoy doing STEM outreach, kayaking, hiking, cycling, art,
								traveling, cooking, watching hockey, and spending time with my partner and family.
