								I'm currently a M.Sc. Engineering: Data Science student at the University of California, 
								Riverside, working from my hometown of Nashville, TN. My c I previously got my B.Sc. in Astronomy 
								from the University of Arizona in May 2018.
								<br>
								<br>
								 
								I have always been interested in space since a very early age, and decided to study Astronomy after 
								watching the 1997 movie adaptation of Carl Sagan's <i>Contact</i> when I was 13. After this, I 
								began volunteering at Vanderbilt University's Dyer Observatory in 2009 leading student space camps, 
								operating telescopes, and giving nightly public tours and talks (and still do on occasion). I attended 
								the University of Arizona from 2014-2018, where I was a student Telescope Operator, and eventually Chief 
								Telescope Operator, for Steward Observatory, where I oversaw nightly operations of on-campus telescopes, 
								managed a team of other student operators, and continued to give astronomical talks at public observing nights.

								After graduating in 2018, I had to unexpectedly move back to Nashville, and began working at Apple, first doing 
								software and hardware repairs as part of the Genius Bar team, and later as part of specialized short-term corporate
								programs for Data Engineering and Data Science Engineering in 2020 and 2021. In Fall 2021, I left Apple and began my
								M.S. program, and began interning at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on the Earth Information Systems 
								team. In Summer 2022, I worked as a Computing Scholar at the 2022 Data Science Institute at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
								developing tools for visualizing Machine Learning model optimization, and presented in the LLNL 2022 Summer Grad Slam. I also
								 participated in a student challenge problem researching ML applications for drug compound screening for COVID-19
								<i>(see Research page for more info)</i>.
								<br>
								<br>

								In Fall 2022, I worked at NASA Langley Research Center on the OCIO Information, Data, & Analytics Services (IDAS) team, 
								developing a project called the “The Machine Learning Showroom,” teaching other NASA researchers how to incorporate Machine
								Learning into their work. As of January 2023, I currently work at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center researching Deep Learning
								applications for detecting ice blocks in the 'chaos terrain' regions on Jupiter's moon Europa.

								In June 2023, I will be graduating with my Masters, and hope to continue performing research on Machine Learning applications
								for large-scale astrophysics surveys. In my free time, I enjoy doing science outreach, kayaking, hiking, cycling, art, coding, 
								traveling, cooking, watching hockey, and spending time with my family, friends, partner, and my 3 cats.
