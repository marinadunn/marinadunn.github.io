						<h2>TIMESTEP</h2>
					</a>
					<p>
						The Tucson Initiative for Minoritized Engagement in Science and
						Technology Program (TIMESTEP), initiated by Astronomy Professor Dr.
						Gurtina Besla in 2015, focuses on fostering success among
						underrepresented undergraduates in academia while addressing
						stereotypes in STEM fields. As a student leader within TIMESTEP, I
						spearheaded efforts to provide mentorship, facilitate discussions on
						academic navigation and industry opportunities, and participated in
						workshops aimed at combating stereotypes and enhancing career
						development skills. I remain engaged as an occasional panelist,
						offering insights and support as requested.

						<h2>UA Astronomy Club</h2>
					</a>
					<p>
						I joined the UA Astronomy Club in 2014, initially as a member, and
						later serving as Outreach Coordinator and President. Here, I
						endeavored to enhance STEM education accessibility by expanding our
						outreach program to have a larger presence in the Tucson community.
						I initiated partnerships with local schools, providing telescope
						viewings and developing engaging STEM activities for children at no
						cost, aiming to highlight strong women and underrepresented
						scientists in our academic community. Additionally, in an effort to
						improve resources for undergraduate success, I established a regular
						tutoring program for upper-division Physics/Astronomy courses not
						provided by university tutoring services. I also fervently advocated
						and successfully lobbied for increased department funding for the
						club to support the growth of our outreach initiatives. Thanks to
						these efforts, it is now one of the largest undergraduate astronomy
						organizations in the country.

						<h2>Astronomy Camp</h2>
					</a>
					<p>
						In 2015, I began working alongside Dr. Don McCarthy overseeing the
						Astronomy Camp program at Kitt Peak and Mt. Lemmon, where I've been
						dedicated to nurturing the curiosity of numerous young science
						enthusiasts. Over several weeks each year, I oversee the students'
						welfare, manage operations, and lead engaging all-night observing
						sessions using state-of-the-art telescopes. I curate educational
						content, including computational astronomy projects, and employ
						inquiry-based learning techniques to instill fundamental principles
						of astronomy, physics, engineering, environmental science, and
						computing. Through hands-on experiences with large-aperture
						telescopes, electronic instrumentation, and astronomy image
						processing software, students explore the intricacies of real
						research methods. Beyond nurturing a deeper understanding of space
						sciences, this program fosters lasting friendships within a
						supportive community.
