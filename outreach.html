							<p> TIMESTEP is a program started by Dr. Gurtina Besla in 2015.
               						 As a student leader for the Tucson Initiative for Minority Engagement in Science and Technology Program (TIMESTEP), 
               						 I led an effort to help undergraduates succeed in academia, learn professional development skills, and combat persistent stereotypes in STEM. 
                					In this capacity, I led discussions about my own experiences navigating my degree, and opportunities in industry-related careers. 
                					I coordinated hands-on workshops for battling stereotypes in academia, and developing skills to achieve career goals.
              						</p>

							<a href='https://uaastroclub.org'><h2>UA Astronomy Club</h2> </a>
							<p> In 2014, I joined the UA Astronomy Club. I then began taking a more active role,
							first as the Outreach Coordinator, and later as President. It was important to me that students have access to STEM opportunities, 
							so I expanded our outreach program to include a larger presence in the Tucson community, 
                					which has a large population of underserved Hispanic and Latinx individuals. By partnering with local schools, we provided telescopes and created activities aimed 
                					at teaching kids about planetary science, astrophysics, and math at no cost. I recruited female students to join me at telescope observing sessions at schools, 
               						exposing young students to strong female scientists. I also established resources for more junior undergraduates to be successful in their academic paths, 
                					including organizing a regular tutoring program for upper-division astrophysics classes, which was not offered through university tutoring services. 
                
                					I was a vocal advocate of additional funding for the organization in order to continue providing exceptional work, 
                					and now it is one of the largest undergraduate astronomy programs in the country.
              						</p>

							<a href='https://www.astronomycamp.org'><h2>Astronomy Camp</h2> </a> 
							<p> In 2015, I began assisting Dr. Don McCarthy in the annual Astronomy Camp program at Kitt Peak and Mt. Lemmon, 
                					looking after dozens of young students interested in science. For several weeks, in addition to overseeing the wellbeing of the students, 
               						I oversee operations and facilitate all-night observing sessions with professional telescopes. I teach them how to use image-processing software,
                					and develop engaging educational content, including projects to strengthen computational programming skills throughout their visit. This program allows
                					young students gain a deeper understanding of the space sciences and real research techniques, and provides a space to form friendships through community.
