							<p> The Tucson Initiative for Minoritized Engagement in Science and Technology Program (TIMESTEP) is a program started by Astronomy Professor
								Dr. Gurtina Besla in 2015. As a student leader for the program, I led an effort to help undergraduates succeed in academia, learn
								professional development skills, and combat persistent stereotypes in STEM. In this capacity, I led discussions about my own
								experiences navigating my degree, and opportunities in industry-related careers, and participated in hands-on workshops for battling
								stereotypes in academia, and developing skills to achieve career goals. I continue to serve as an occasional panelist
								by request.

							<a href='https://uaastroclub.org'><h2>UA Astronomy Club</h2> </a>
							<p> In 2014, I joined the UA Astronomy Club. I then began taking a more active role,
								first as the Outreach Coordinator, and later as President. It was important to me that students have access
								to STEM opportunities, so I expanded our outreach program to include a larger presence in the Tucson community.
								By partnering with local schools, we provided telescopes and created activities aimed at teaching kids about
								planetary science, astrophysics, and math at no cost. I also established resources for junior undergraduates
								to be successful in their academic paths, including organizing ATOMM: a regular tutoring program for upper-division
								astrophysics classes, which was not offered through university tutoring services. I was a vocal advocate of
								additional funding for the organization in order to continue providing exceptional work, and now it is one of
								the largest undergraduate astronomy programs in the country.

							<a href='https://www.astronomycamp.org'><h2>Astronomy Camp</h2> </a>
							<p> In 2015, I began assisting Dr. Don McCarthy in the annual Astronomy Camp program at Kitt Peak and Mt. Lemmon,
                					looking after dozens of young students interested in science. For several weeks, in addition to overseeing
									the wellbeing of the students, I oversee operations and facilitate all-night observing sessions with professional telescopes,
									develop educational content (including computational astronomy projects), and teach students about basic principles of
									 astronomy, physics, engineering, environmental science, and computing using inquiry-based learning techniques, as well as
									 large-aperture telescopes, electronic instrumentation, & astronomy image processing software. This program allows
                					young students gain a deeper understanding of the space sciences and real research techniques, and provides a space
									to form friendships through community.
